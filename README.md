Game Title: TIC TAC TOE

TIC TAC TOE

OVERVIEW: 
We are going to create Tic Tac Toe Game in C++. This will be a simple
console-based application in which the player can play the Tic Tac Toe game and
also the player can choose from two available modes which are playing with a
computer and playing with a friend.
FEATURES: 

● Two game modes are available to play. First play with a computer and
second play with a friend

● Max score of both the player is updated after each round

● The player can decide to replay the game after each round

GAME RULES: 

● The game must be played by two players (in this program between
human and computer or human and human).

● Both players mark their cells with the letters "O" and "X".

● The game ends when one of the players fills an entire row, column or
diagonal with either the character ('O' or 'X') of that player.

● If no one wins, the match is considered a draw.

CONCLUSION: 

We have built the Tic Tac Toe Game in C++ which is very simple to follow and
develop. We can develop this game by adding more creative thoughts, like we
can take 2 players name from the user and print that on screen. It’ll show first
name for the first player, and second name for the second player.
